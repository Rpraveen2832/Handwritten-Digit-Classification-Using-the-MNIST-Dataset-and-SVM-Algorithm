# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-the-MNIST-Dataset-and-SVM-Algorithm
  This project implements a linear classification system for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with a linear kernel. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

Key Features

  Data Preparation: Fetches the MNIST dataset, normalizes the pixel values, and splits the data into training and testing sets.
  
  Model Creation: Utilizes the LinearSVC class from Scikit-learn to create a linear SVM classifier.
  
  Model Training: Trains the SVM classifier on the training data.
  
  Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.
  
  Visualization: Visualizes some sample predictions along with their true labels.
